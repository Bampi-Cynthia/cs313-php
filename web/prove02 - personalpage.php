	<h1> About me</h1>
	
	<p>Hello! I am a sophomore at BYU-Idaho, studying Web Design and Web Development. I love photograph and design. I will be ready to graduate in december 2018.

I am a mom of three beautiful kids, and married to my best friend for 10 years. We currently live in Utah, and a beautiful place to live, explore and photograph.

My dream is one day to have my own business and photograph and designing. Hopefully you will like my work!</p>
