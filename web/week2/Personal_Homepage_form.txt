GET - Request data from a specific resource

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I just tried to have a page that follows what the assignment asks, and excel a little on the design in order to do more.
I am new to PHP so I did not attempted to do more than it was required for now. Hopefully I soon will be able to.
